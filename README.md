# termux-launcher

A sample "app_list" file is included.

The app_list is updated every time the app is launched.

The name of the script is "open"

Apk file is attached. This apk is not the final build.

To use the script "open", you must add the script in your path variable.


Inspired by:
https://github.com/amsitlab/termuxlauncher
but this creates a hard coded script and i wanted to make a autocompletion.
